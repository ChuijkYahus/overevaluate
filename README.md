# Hexsets

Adds a simple blackbox iota. You can not remove its contents, but it is extremely fast to test the existence of an iota inside it, to add an iota, and to remove an iota if it exists. You can also determine length with Length Purification. Ultimately, it's nothing too special, just a little utility addon to get things working.
